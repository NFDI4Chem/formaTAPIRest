# TAPIR: A REST interface providing file format conversions

Format conversions are a common and important operation in data analysis and data archiving. 

## Overview
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project. By using the
[OpenAPI-Spec](https://openapis.org) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This
is an example of building a OpenAPI-enabled Flask server.

This example uses the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask.

The server was generated via
```
docker run --rm --workdir /local -v ${PWD}:/local openapitools/openapi-generator-cli  generate -i /local/openapi/openapi.yaml  -g python-flask -c config.yaml -o /local
```

## Requirements
Python 3.5.2+

## Usage
To run the server, please execute the following from the root directory:

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m openapi_server
```

and open your browser to here:

```
http://localhost:8080/formaTAPIRest/v1/ui/
```

Your OpenAPI definition lives here:

```
http://localhost:8080/formaTAPIRest/v1/openapi.json
```

Some example calls via CURL are:
```
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/formaTAPIRest/v1/convert/mzXML/to/mzML" -H  "accept: application/xml:" -H  "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "profile=" -F "inputfile=@BSA-FT-HCD.raw;type=application/octet-stream"
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8080/formaTAPIRest/v1/convert/mzXML/to/mzML" -H  "accept: application/xml:" -H  "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" -F "profile=xxx" -F "inputfile=@test.mzXML"
```

To launch the integration tests, use tox:
```
sudo pip install tox
tox
```

## Python example
```
import requests
```

Test if server is active
```
req = requests.get('http://localhost:8080/formaTAPIRest/v1/ping')
print(req.status_code)
```

Get list of available conversions
```
req = requests.get('http://localhost:8080/formaTAPIRest/v1/list')
print(req.text)
```

Test by converting png into jpg image
```
with open('kitty.png', 'rb') as f:
    data = f.read()
req = requests.post(url='http://localhost:8080/formaTAPIRest/v1/convert/png/to/jpg', data=data, headers={'Content-Type': 'application/octet-stream'})
print(req.status_code)
with open('kitty.jpg', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(req.content)
```

## Running with Docker

To run the server on a Docker container, please execute the following from the root directory:

```bash
# building the image
docker build -t openapi_server .

# starting up a container
docker run -p 8080:8080 openapi_server
```
